Project : The applications is a game of alien invasion using ARKit

Flaws : 
	1. Sometimes the application fails to support png images, hence using jpg images for now
	2. The Laser only throws and receives at the center of the phone screen (i.e. center of the camera)

Note : The aliens are stopped at a distance from camera, so the player can play the game for long. But still, after the alien stops and camera is moved and it hits the alien player loses 2 health.
